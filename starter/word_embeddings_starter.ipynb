    "3. Use embeddings for **similarity search** and **analogy / vector algebra**.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Validates embedding quality** — If embeddings capture meaningful structure, analogies should work\n",
    "2. **Illustrates the \"linear substructure\" hypothesis** — Relationships like gender, tense, or country-capital are often parallel vectors\n",
    "3. **Common interview/exam topic** — The king–queen analogy is a classic NLP question\n",
    "4. **Foundation for downstream tasks** — Understanding vector arithmetic helps with transfer learning and feature engineering\n",

    "Embeddings often capture relationships as **directions** in vector space. The idea is:\n",

    "> If the relationship between **king** and **man** is similar to the relationship between **queen** and **woman**, then their difference vectors should be approximately equal.\n",

    "### Important caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analogies are an intrinsic evaluation** — They test the embedding space itself, not real-world task performance\n",
    "- **Results are dataset-dependent** — A model trained on news articles may not capture analogies about cooking or medicine\n",

    "- **Bag-of-Words** treats documents as unordered collections of words. Simple and fast, but loses word order and has no notion of similarity.\n",
    "- **N-grams** capture local word sequences (bigrams, trigrams), preserving some order. However, they explode in size and remain sparse.\n",
    "- **Word2Vec** learns dense, low-dimensional vectors where **semantically similar words are close together**. This enables similarity search, analogies, and better generalization to unseen data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why this is in the notebook\n",
    "Vector algebra (analogies) demonstrates one of the most remarkable properties of word embeddings: **semantic relationships are encoded as geometric directions**. This section is included because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validates embedding quality** — If embeddings capture meaningful structure, analogies should work\n",
    "2. **Illustrates the \"linear substructure\" hypothesis** — Relationships like gender, tense, or country-capital are often parallel vectors\n",
    "3. **Common interview/exam topic** — The king–queen analogy is a classic NLP question\n",
    "4. **Foundation for downstream tasks** — Understanding vector arithmetic helps with transfer learning and feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### How vector algebra works\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings often capture relationships as **directions** in vector space. The idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the relationship between **king** and **man** is similar to the relationship between **queen** and **woman**, then their difference vectors should be approximately equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically:\n",
    "$$\\vec{king} - \\vec{man} \\approx \\vec{queen} - \\vec{woman}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging:\n",
    "$$\\vec{king} - \\vec{man} + \\vec{woman} \\approx \\vec{queen}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classic example\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{king} - \\text{man} + \\text{woman} \\approx \\text{queen} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This works *sometimes* because the model learns consistent patterns across many contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other analogy types that embeddings can capture\n",
    "\n",
    "| Relationship | Example |\n",
    "|--------------|---------|\n",
    "| Verb tense | walk : walked :: swim : swam |\n",
    "| Country–capital | France : Paris :: Japan : Tokyo |\n",
    "| Comparative | big : bigger :: small : smaller |\n",
    "| Plural | cat : cats :: dog : dogs |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analogies are an intrinsic evaluation** — They test the embedding space itself, not real-world task performance\n",
    "- **Results are dataset-dependent** — A model trained on news articles may not capture analogies about cooking or medicine\n",
    "- **Not always reliable** — Even good embeddings can fail on specific analogies due to data biases or polysemy (words with multiple meanings)\n",
    "- **Sensitive to corpus size** — Small corpora may not provide enough context for consistent relationship patterns"

    "| **Unit of learning** | Whole words | Words + character n-grams (subwords) |\n",
    "| **Vocabulary** | Fixed at training time | Can generate vectors for unseen words |\n",
    "| **OOV (out-of-vocabulary) handling** | ❌ Cannot handle — returns error | ✅ Builds vector from subword pieces |\n",
    "| **Morphological variants** | Treated as separate tokens (run ≠ running) | Related by shared subwords (run ≈ running) |\n",
    "| **Typos and misspellings** | ❌ No vector available | ✅ Still produces reasonable vector |\n",

    "- You need **faster training** and smaller models\n",
    "- Your corpus is **clean** with minimal typos\n",
    "- You're working with **English or morphologically simple languages**\n",
    "- Memory and storage are constrained\n",

    "\n",
    "✅ **Choose FastText when:**\n",
    "- You expect **out-of-vocabulary words** at inference time\n",
    "- Working with **user-generated content** (social media, reviews, chat)\n",
    "- Your domain has **technical jargon** or rare terminology\n",
    "- Working with **morphologically rich languages** (German, Finnish, Turkish, Arabic)\n",
    "- You need to handle **typos, slang, or informal spelling**\n",
    "- New words/products/entities appear frequently\n",
