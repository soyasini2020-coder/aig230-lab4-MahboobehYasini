    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Explain **distributional semantics** (\"meaning from context\").\n",
    "2. Train word embeddings using **Word2Vec** and **FastText** (with Gensim).\n",
    "3. Use embeddings for **similarity search** and **analogy / vector algebra**.\n",
    "4. Visualize a word embedding space and interpret what you see.\n",
    "5. Explain why embeddings help with **sparsity** and **generalization** compared to n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry relevance (why you should care)\n",
    "Even in the era of transformers, embeddings remain widely used for:\n",
    "- **Semantic search** and query expansion  \n",
    "- **Similarity / recommendation** (nearest neighbors in vector space)  \n",
    "- **Clustering** and exploratory analysis  \n",
    "- Lightweight NLP systems where large models are too expensive"
